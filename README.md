# Animation and Video Game Development
Work is divided into folders named for the classes they were completed in.  
### Maya
Each class that used Maya will have a folder containing a Maya workspace, a Scenes folder, and an Images folder.  
The Scenes folder contains the scene files for each finished model, while the Images folder contains screenshots of models, uv maps, etc. 

### Scripting Essentials
All scripts for this class file are organized like the initial forked files. All code written before the Unity modules will be under "C# Basics", while code written after will be under "Unity" instead.
