# Animation and Video Game Development
Work is divided into folders named for the classes they were completed in.  
### Maya
Each class that used Maya will have a folder containing a Maya workspace, a Scenes folder, and an Image folder.  
The Scenes folder contains the scene files for each finished model, while the Image folder contains screenshots of models, uv maps, etc. 

### C# Basics
Inside Scripting Essentials there is a folder named "C# Basics." This folder holds the files for Unit 2, including the files from the C# Essentials repository in Unit 0.
