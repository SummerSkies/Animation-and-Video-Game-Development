# Animation and Video Game Development
Work is divided into folders named for the classes they were completed in.  
### Maya
Each class that used Maya will have a folder containing a Maya workspace, a Scenes folder, an Images folder, and a Source Images folder.  
The Scenes folder contains the scene files for each finished model, Source Images has any textures imported back into Maya, and Images has most assignment deliverables.  
The Images folder has a subfolder, Deliverables, which contains all images taken for submisson. All images are separated into folders by assignment.

### Scripting Essentials
This folder has the initial forked files from before the Unity units.  All other root folders are their own unity projects.

### Unity
All Unity assgnemnts with their own projects will be in their own folder under the class the assignment was for.  
If the project was made for Unity's Create with Code lessons, the commits will be named for each part as I complete them.

### The Ghost Game Reborn
Next to all the class files, there is a folder named "The Ghost Game Reborn." This is my own personal Unity project that I used to complete various assignments and sometimes worked with on my own time. If an assignment was completed using this project, I should have let you know in a comment under my submission.
