# Animation and Video Game Development
Work is divided into folders named for the classes they were completed in.  
### Maya
Each class that used Maya will have a folder containing a Maya workspace, a Scenes folder, and an Images folder.  
The Scenes folder contains the scene files for each finished model, while the Images folder contains screenshots of models, uv maps, etc. 

### Scripting Essentials
All scripts for this class file are organized like the initial forked files. All code written before the Unity modules will be under "C# Basics/Basics." Any assignments after that did not involve making a new Unity project will be under "C# Basics/Unity."  

### Unity
All Unity assgnemnts with their own projects will be in their own folder under the class the assignment was for.  

### The Ghost Game Reborn
Next to all the class files, there is a folder named "The Ghost Game Reborn." This is my own personal Unity project that I used to complete various assignments and worked with on my own time to make a demo video game. If an assignment was completed using this project, I should have let you know in a comment under my submission.
