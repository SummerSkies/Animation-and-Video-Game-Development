# Animation and Video Game Development
Work is divided into folders named for the classes they were completed in.  
### Maya
Each class that used Maya will have a folder containing a Maya workspace, a Scenes folder, and a Showcases folder.  
The Scenes folder contains the scene files for each finished model, while the Showcases folder contains three-quarter screenshots of each finished model.
